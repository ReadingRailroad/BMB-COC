      Modifications for this version:
      March, 1988  Fixed a bug in reading a capture history matrix
                   from a file during interactive input.
      March, 1988  Modified "S u m m a r y   b y   L o t s" output
                   to provide standard errors and use t statistic for CI.
      May, 1989    Modified Chi-square tests to provide power of
                   test with EXPECT option on PROCs SIMULATE and CHISQ.
      May, 1989    Added GTEST option to PROCS to provide likelihood
                   ratio G tests instead of Pearson chi-square tests.
      Aug, 1991    Added Akaike's Information Criterion Calculation
      May, 1992    Added AICFILE and GOFFILE options to SIMULATE
      May, 1992    Added EBV parameter (Extended Binomial Var.) to SIMULATE
      May, 1992    Capture histories converted from INTEGER to REAL
      May, 1992    NOBINCOEF option in SIMULATE to remove mult. coef. from Like.
      May, 1992    AICMEAN option in SIMULATE for true parameter values.
      Dec, 1993    FPOOL option to use Fisher Exact P-values in summary tests.

               TEST 1 is an omnibus  test for a treatment  effect(s),
               i.e., significant differences between groups.  For the
               Complete Capture History protocol and Scheme A Partial
               Capture History protocol, TEST 1 is an overall test of
               equality  of all  survival and  capture  probabilities
               among groups.
