# BMB-COC
Initial Bigmouth Buffalo and Common Carp Code 

This is my first attempt (10/3/2018) to import some of my COC and BMB data and code already written to Git so that I can access it from more devices than my personal laptop I suppose. Mostly EDA. Perhaps in the near future some RMark files as well.

Probably have to make sure I update the .csv files on Github to make sure I get current and up to date data after new sampling events :)

- at this point I'm not sure if a single 'new' markdown with chunks copied and pasted from other files will be the way to go for each distinction (harvest, cpue, cmr, etc.) __Probably one rmd for each dissertation chapter.

I think. I think....


Later, on 10/3/2018 I hooked up my personal laptop to the project and uploaded existing code and data.

- very messy at this point. Haven't found a way to create folders in the project yet, but maybe that's what they meant by - very messy at this point. Haven't found a way to create folders in the project yet, but maybe that's what they meant by

- Complete data file is missing. Not necessarily missing, just unavailable. SSD from personal laptop is in unit being serviced at HP.

- Need to take a comprehensive look and use a systematic approach to double check all sampling events and tags are entered, name the file better, and get it onto GIT.
