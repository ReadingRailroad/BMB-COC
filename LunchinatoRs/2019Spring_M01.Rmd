# Tidyverse
R for data science by hadley wickam

_gt_ package for tables: really nice table function from github
__gganimate__  for moving figures: animated plots (example on lunchinators github)
__here__ for working directory things (why should I use the here package)
__tidymodels__ loads family of packages (rsample, recipes, caret...) in the github repository (broom takes model output and makes it tidy)
__rayshader__ package for elevation mapping


## Nesting and mapping
for adjusting tibbles within tibbles
"map" is part of purrr
            look for purrr cheatsheet
